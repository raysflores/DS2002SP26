    "You are going to hear a lot of people talk about SQL like it is a set of magic spells: `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`. That framing is backwards. SQL is boring on purpose. It exists because organizations need a way to store facts so those facts don’t quietly mutate when the spreadsheet gets copied, when the intern “fixes” a column, or when three different teams each keep their own version of “the customer list.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture is about learning the *reason* SQL exists, then learning how to design tables so your queries have a chance of being correct. Only after that do we start writing SQL. If you remember one thing, remember this: when the structure is wrong, the analysis is wrong, and SQL will happily return an answer anyway.\n"

    "# Why Structured Data Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data is not an academic obsession. It is a survival mechanism for scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a small online store in week one. One person is taking orders in a Google Sheet. The sheet has a column called `Customer`, a column called `Items`, and a column called `Total`. That works until the first real-world event happens: a customer changes their email, a product’s price changes, returns start happening, or two employees edit the sheet at the same time. Suddenly “the truth” is whatever the last person typed, and the history is a blur of edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine you are doing analytics for that store and you are asked, “How much did we earn from keyboards last month?” If keyboards are stored as text inside a comma-separated cell, you can’t reliably count them. If prices are repeated in multiple rows, price updates become inconsistent. If customer information is duplicated, you will treat one human as multiple humans. The result is not just messy data. The result is decisions made from wrong numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data means you write down what a row *means* and what a column *means*, and you enforce it. A database is a place where facts are stored with constraints, not vibes.\n"

    "# Why SQL, Specifically?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is the language we use to interact with structured data stored in relational databases. It is “relational” because data is not stored as one giant table; it is stored as multiple tables that relate to each other using keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL persists because it solves a universal problem: asking precise questions of data that is too large and too shared to live safely inside spreadsheets. When you ask for “all orders from last week” you want a consistent definition of what an “order” is. When you ask for “average purchase price by product” you want each product to be represented consistently. SQL gives you a common vocabulary to describe those questions, and databases give you enforcement so the data stays sane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason SQL matters in data science is practical: most serious datasets you will touch in industry are stored in systems where SQL is the front door. Even when the rest of your pipeline is Python, the data often begins as SQL queries.\n"

In this lecture, we will use a small in-memory database so you can see SQL working without installing anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a tiny e-commerce-style dataset. That sounds trivial, but it’s perfect for learning because it has the same structure as real systems: customers place orders, orders contain items, items correspond to products.\n"

    "# Before We Normalize: What Goes Wrong in the Real World\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is a set of design rules. Those rules exist to prevent three common failure modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first failure mode is the **update problem**. You store the same fact in multiple places, and when the fact changes, you forget to update one of them. You don’t notice until reporting disagrees with reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second failure mode is the **insert problem**. You want to store a fact, but your table design forces you to invent unrelated data just to fill a row. That leads to placeholder values, nulls, and strange “fake records” that later contaminate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third failure mode is the **delete problem**. You remove one row and accidentally remove the only copy of an important fact because that fact was stored in a table that mixed multiple kinds of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is basically “design so these don’t happen.”\n"

    "\n",

    "A bad sentence sounds like: “Each row represents an order plus the customer details plus the product details plus the price at the time.” That is a spreadsheet sentence. Databases want you to separate concerns.\n"

    "\n",
    "A helpful way to keep your brain straight is to ask: “What is the entity here?” An entity is a thing you care about and want to refer to repeatedly. Customers are entities. Products are entities. Orders are entities. If you find yourself repeating the same attributes over and over, you probably have an entity hiding in your table that deserves its own table.\n"

Filtering for orders that contain a mouse requires text parsing. Joining to a products table becomes awkward because the value is no longer a single product identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, this is how dashboards become fragile. Someone misspells “Keyboard” once and now you have two product categories. Or someone writes “keyboard” in lowercase and your counts drift. You can’t enforce consistency because the database can’t see individual values inside the cell.\n"

In most systems, the price describes the product (or perhaps the product at a time), not the order itself. That means `product_price` depends on `product_id`, not on the full composite key. That violates 2NF.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the update problem in disguise. If the price of a keyboard changes from 50 to 55, you would have to update every row where product_id = 101. Miss one, and now your data contains two truths.\n"

If a customer changes their email, you want one place to update it. If you accidentally let multiple “Alices” exist with slightly different emails, you will miscount customers and your marketing spend becomes inefficient.\n",

When you do that, you still store it intentionally, and you name the column honestly (for example, `unit_price_at_purchase`). The difference between good design and bad design is not “never duplicate,” it is “duplicate with meaning and control.”\n"
