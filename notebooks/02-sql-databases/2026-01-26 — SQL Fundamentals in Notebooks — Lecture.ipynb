That framing is backwards. SQL is boring on purpose. It exists because organizations need a way to store facts so those facts don’t quietly mutate when the spreadsheet gets copied, when the intern “fixes” a column, or when three different teams each keep their own version of “the customer list.”\n\nThis lecture is about learning the *reason* SQL exists, then learning how to design tables so your queries have a chance of being correct. Only after that do we start writing SQL. If you remember one thing, remember this: when the structure is wrong, the analysis is wrong, and SQL will happily return an answer anyway.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"17af2944e25b540b","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# Why Structured Data Matters\n\nStructured data is not an academic obsession. It is a survival mechanism for scale.\n\nImagine a small online store in week one. One person is taking orders in a Google Sheet. The sheet has a column called `Customer`, a column called `Items`, and a column called `Total`. That works until the first real-world event happens: a customer changes their email, a product’s price changes, returns start happening, or two employees edit the sheet at the same time. Suddenly “the truth” is whatever the last person typed, and the history is a blur of edits.\n\nNow imagine you are doing analytics for that store and you are asked, “How much did we earn from keyboards last month?” If keyboards are stored as text inside a comma-separated cell, you can’t reliably count them. If prices are repeated in multiple rows, price updates become inconsistent. If customer information is duplicated, you will treat one human as multiple humans. The result is not just messy data. The result is decisions made from wrong numbers.\n\nStructured data means you write down what a row *means* and what a column *means*, and you enforce it. A database is a place where facts are stored with constraints, not vibes.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"a3be54027a140765","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# Why SQL, Specifically?\n\nSQL is the language we use to interact with structured data stored in relational databases. It is “relational” because data is not stored as one giant table; it is stored as multiple tables that relate to each other using keys.\n\nSQL persists because it solves a universal problem: asking precise questions of data that is too large and too shared to live safely inside spreadsheets. When you ask for “all orders from last week” you want a consistent definition of what an “order” is. When you ask for “average purchase price by product” you want each product to be represented consistently. SQL gives you a common vocabulary to describe those questions, and databases give you enforcement so the data stays sane.\n\nAnother reason SQL matters in data science is practical: most serious datasets you will touch in industry are stored in systems where SQL is the front door. Even when the rest of your pipeline is Python, the data often begins as SQL queries.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"b64f41536cd3fd2","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# A Notebook Is a Good Place to Learn SQL\n\nNotebooks are useful because they combine explanation with execution. You can read a concept, run a query, see the output, and then change it and run again. That loop is how you learn. In this lecture, we will use a small in-memory database so you can see SQL working without installing anything.\n\nWe will build a tiny e-commerce-style dataset. That sounds trivial, but it’s perfect for learning because it has the same structure as real systems: customers place orders, orders contain items, items correspond to products.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"ab17e2705b43bcc3","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# Before We Normalize: What Goes Wrong in the Real World\n\nNormalization is a set of design rules. Those rules exist to prevent three common failure modes.\n\nThe first failure mode is the **update problem**. You store the same fact in multiple places, and when the fact changes, you forget to update one of them. You don’t notice until reporting disagrees with reality.\n\nThe second failure mode is the **insert problem**. You want to store a fact, but your table design forces you to invent unrelated data just to fill a row. That leads to placeholder values, nulls, and strange “fake records” that later contaminate analysis.\n\nThe third failure mode is the **delete problem**. You remove one row and accidentally remove the only copy of an important fact because that fact was stored in a table that mixed multiple kinds of information.\n\nNormalization is basically “design so these don’t happen.”\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"b99daf8d4f6d5176","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# Thinking in Tables: One Table, One Type of Thing\n\nA table should represent one type of thing. If you can’t say what the rows are in a single sentence, the table is probably trying to do too much.\n\nA good sentence sounds like: “Each row in `customers` represents one customer.” Or: “Each row in `products` represents one product.” Or: “Each row in `orders` represents one order.”\n\nA bad sentence sounds like: “Each row represents an order plus the customer details plus the product details plus the price at the time.” That is a spreadsheet sentence. Databases want you to separate concerns.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"ea20eea6758c4474","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# Normalization: The Core Idea\n\nNormalization is a method for organizing data so that each fact is stored once, in the best place, and relationships connect facts together. You can think of normalization as learning to separate a messy human story into clean components.\n\nA helpful way to keep your brain straight is to ask: “What is the entity here?” An entity is a thing you care about and want to refer to repeatedly. Customers are entities. Products are entities. Orders are entities. If you find yourself repeating the same attributes over and over, you probably have an entity hiding in your table that deserves its own table.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"2628e5be457db2ab","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# First Normal Form (1NF)\n\nFirst Normal Form is about shape. It says: a table must not hide multiple values inside one cell. Each column should hold one value per row, and each row should be identifiable.\n\nConsider a realistic “week one startup” table of orders:\n\n| order_id | customer_email | products |\n|---:|---|---|\n| 1 | alice@example.com | Keyboard, Mouse |\n| 2 | bob@example.com | Keyboard |\n| 3 | alice@example.com | Monitor, HDMI Cable |\n\nThis is not in 1NF because the `products` cell is a list. It feels convenient, but it breaks the moment you try to compute something. Counting keyboards requires splitting strings. Filtering for orders that contain a mouse requires text parsing. Joining to a products table becomes awkward because the value is no longer a single product identifier.\n\nIn the real world, this is how dashboards become fragile. Someone misspells “Keyboard” once and now you have two product categories. Or someone writes “keyboard” in lowercase and your counts drift. You can’t enforce consistency because the database can’t see individual values inside the cell.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"f80b23364af5d768","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## Making It 1NF\n\nTo make this 1NF, you rewrite the table so that each row corresponds to a single product within an order. That means one order will appear in multiple rows, but that is not a problem. That duplication is controlled and meaningful.\n\n| order_id | customer_email | product |\n|---:|---|---|\n| 1 | alice@example.com | Keyboard |\n| 1 | alice@example.com | Mouse |\n| 2 | bob@example.com | Keyboard |\n| 3 | alice@example.com | Monitor |\n| 3 | alice@example.com | HDMI Cable |\n\nNow every cell holds one value. The database can filter, count, and join cleanly. You have taken a messy “list-in-a-cell” and turned it into something the database understands.\n\nIf 1NF feels like “more rows,” that’s correct. Databases are designed for lots of rows. Spreadsheets are designed for human eyeballs. We are not optimizing for eyeballs anymore.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"8c6c35ccf95af420","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# Second Normal Form (2NF)\n\nSecond Normal Form is about meaning. It says: if your table uses a composite key (a key made of multiple columns), then every non-key column must depend on the full key, not just part of it.\n\nThis sounds abstract until you see the common pattern. After converting the “products list” into one row per product, many people create an `order_items` table like this:\n\n| order_id | product_id | product_name | product_price |\n|---:|---:|---|---:|\n| 1 | 101 | Keyboard | 50 |\n| 1 | 102 | Mouse | 20 |\n| 2 | 101 | Keyboard | 50 |\n\nThe intended key here is `(order_id, product_id)` because that pair uniquely identifies a line item.\n\nNow ask a simple dependency question. Does `product_price` depend on the order, the product, or both? In most systems, the price describes the product (or perhaps the product at a time), not the order itself. That means `product_price` depends on `product_id`, not on the full composite key. That violates 2NF.\n\nThis is the update problem in disguise. If the price of a keyboard changes from 50 to 55, you would have to update every row where product_id = 101. Miss one, and now your data contains two truths.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"fa5c18f56213454c","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## Making It 2NF\n\nThe fix is to separate the product facts from the order line items.\n\nYou create a `products` table where product facts live once:\n\n| product_id | name | price |\n|---:|---|---:|\n| 101 | Keyboard | 50 |\n| 102 | Mouse | 20 |\n\nThen your `order_items` table becomes only the relationship between orders and products:\n\n| order_id | product_id |\n|---:|---:|\n| 1 | 101 |\n| 1 | 102 |\n| 2 | 101 |\n\nThis may feel like you are “splitting tables just to split tables,” but it is exactly what makes analytics trustworthy. You have moved product meaning into `products` and left `order_items` as a pure record of what was purchased.\n\nIn real organizations, this separation is what prevents one team from “fixing” a price in their report while another team uses a different price elsewhere. One truth, one place.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"57e17f3f5740d071","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# Third Normal Form (3NF)\n\nThird Normal Form targets a subtler issue: non-key columns must not depend on other non-key columns. This is called a transitive dependency, and it is where a lot of “it mostly works” data designs go to die.\n\nConsider a `customers` table:\n\n| customer_id | city | state |\n|---:|---|---|\n| 1 | Richmond | VA |\n| 2 | Charlottesville | VA |\n| 3 | Raleigh | NC |\n\nAt first glance, this seems fine. But the table is storing a fact about geography. The state is determined by the city, not by the customer. That means `city → state`. The state value is not truly a customer attribute; it is a city attribute that happens to be copied into the customer table.\n\nWhat breaks in the real world? If the city value is misspelled in one row, state can diverge. Or you introduce “Richmond” and accidentally mark it as “NC” once. Now you have a data quality issue that is hard to detect because it looks like a legitimate customer record.\n\n3NF pushes you toward isolating “lookup facts” into separate tables so that you don’t duplicate derived meaning across many records.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"fab6ccb29732714b","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## Making It 3NF\n\nOne clean fix is to separate location facts.\n\nYou keep customers as customers:\n\n| customer_id | city |\n|---:|---|\n| 1 | Richmond |\n| 2 | Charlottesville |\n| 3 | Raleigh |\n\nThen you store the city-to-state mapping once:\n\n| city | state |\n|---|---|\n| Richmond | VA |\n| Charlottesville | VA |\n| Raleigh | NC |\n\nNow if a city’s state mapping needs correction, it is corrected once. Customers no longer carry a duplicated fact that is not truly about them.\n\nIn larger systems, you might store a `location_id` and keep a separate `locations` table. The pattern is the same: keep facts where they belong.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"c720d7bf0d624f20","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# A Short Summary of 1NF, 2NF, 3NF\n\nFirst Normal Form prevents you from hiding lists inside cells and forces your data into a queryable shape.\n\nSecond Normal Form prevents you from storing attributes in a table where they only depend on part of a composite key, which is how you get repeated facts and inconsistent updates.\n\nThird Normal Form prevents you from mixing “side facts” into an entity table, which is how you get subtle contradictions that are hard to notice until analysis fails.\n\nIf you learn to spot these violations, you can walk into almost any messy dataset and design a safer version of it.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"4debf65fd5e06c17","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n# SQL Command Categories\n\nSQL has different kinds of commands, and learning the categories keeps you from feeling lost.\n\nData Definition Language (DDL) is how you define structure.

product.\n\nEach row in `orders` represents one order placed by one customer.\n\nEach row in `order_items` represents one product included in one order, including quantity.\n\nIf you can say those

consistent truths in shared data.\n\nStructured data is valuable because it makes analysis reliable and operations safer.\n\nNormalization is how you design tables so each fact lives where it belongs.\n\nDDL creates the structure, DML fills it with facts, and `SELECT` is how you ask questions.\n\nMost importantly, JOIN is not a trick. JOIN is the natural result of a clean design.\n","metadata":{}}]}
