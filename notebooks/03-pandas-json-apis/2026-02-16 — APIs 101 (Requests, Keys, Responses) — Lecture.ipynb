The goal is not just to “get something working,” but to build a mental model you can reuse.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"b8963edc","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## 1. The Problem APIs Solve\n\nImagine you want the same piece of information repeatedly, for many different inputs.\n\nExamples:\n- “Give me a list of universities in a country.”\n- “Give me today’s weather for a city.”\n- “Give me the last 30 days of stock prices.”\n- “Give me all orders placed yesterday.”\n\nYou *could* download a file every time and re-import it, but that does not scale and does not stay current.\n\nInstead, modern systems expose data through a controlled, structured interface:\n- you send a request\n- you receive a response\n- the data is formatted consistently\n- the provider can apply rules (limits, authentication, logging)\n\nThat interface is an API.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"38cb9f30","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## 2. What an API Is (in Plain English)\n\nAPI stands for **Application Programming Interface**.\n\nThat sounds abstract, so use this definition for this course:\n\nAn API is a **published way to ask a system for data or actions**, using a structured request format that the system agrees to support.\n\nWhen we say “call an API,” we mean:\n- your program sends a request in a standard way\n- the service answers with data (often JSON)\n\nMost APIs we use in data work today are **web APIs**, meaning the request travels over the internet using HTTP.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"eca5e70a","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## 3. The Restaurant Model \n\nA restaurant is a good analogy because it includes all the important ideas:\n\n- The **menu** is the documentation: it tells you what you can ask for.\n- You don’t walk into the kitchen; you place an **order**.\n- The waiter takes your request to the system and brings back a **response**.\n- The restaurant can say “no” if you ask for something unsupported.\n- If you come too often, they can slow you down or refuse service.\n\nAPIs work the same way:\n- the provider decides what is available\n- you must request it in the format they accept\n- you receive a structured response\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"163548e2","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## 4. HTTP: The Transport Layer for Web APIs\n\nMost web APIs use **HTTP**, the same protocol your browser uses.\n\nWhen you visit a webpage, your browser sends an HTTP request.\n\nWhen you call an API, your Python code sends an HTTP request.\n\nThe difference is mainly in *what comes back*:\n- webpages return HTML meant for humans\n- APIs return machine-readable data (usually JSON)\n\nIn this course, we will focus on HTTP `GET` requests because they are the most common way to retrieve data.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"a3b8649e","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## 5. Anatomy of a Request (URL + Method + Optional Extras)\n\nA typical API request includes:\n\n1. **Method** (GET, POST, etc.)\n2. **URL** (where to send the request)\n3. **Query parameters** (extra inputs in the URL)\n4. **Headers** (metadata, often authentication)\n5. **Body** (for POST/PUT, usually not needed for simple GET)\n\nWe will learn each part by actually making requests.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"21dfcc26","cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## 6.
