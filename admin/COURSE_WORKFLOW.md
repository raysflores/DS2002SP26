# Course Workflow (My+TA Notes)

- Kaggle is the execution environment.
- GitHub is the artifact + versioning layer.
- Canvas is submissions + grades.
- Teams is communication.

Suggested cadence:
- Friday labs due Sunday 11:59pm (unless Canvas says otherwise).
- Homework extensions due Sunday 11:59pm.

This repo contains placeholders for every notebook by date.
